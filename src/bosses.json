            "lore": "The cleric beasts owe their name to a rumor that they were originally members of Yharnam's clergy transformed by the old blood. After defeating the Cleric Beast, one obtains the Sword Hunter Badge which states in its description:\n‘One of the badges crafted by the Healing Church. The silver sword is a symbol of a Church hunter. Ludwig was the first of many Healing Church hunters to come, many of Whom were clerics. As it was, clerics transformed into the most hideous beasts.’\nThis suggests that the cleric beast was a member of the Healing Church and possibly a hunter employed under Ludwig that succumbed to the scourge of the beast, leading to their descent into beasthood.",

            "lore": "Gascoigne was a priest in a foreign land, where he earned the title of 'father'. At some point in his life, Gascoigne travelled to Yharnam and eventually joined the Healing Church as a hunter. Upon joining the Church as a hunter, Gascoigne was partnered with Henryk, an older hunter. The two made an effective duo, and their effectiveness led to Henryk's 'tragically' long life.\n\nAt some point, Father Gascoigne took a wife by the name of Viola and the pair had children. As Gascoigne continued to hunt, he began to be affected by the bloodlust, even forgetting his family. Viola was known to play a Tiny Music Box, a memento of theirs, in order to draw him home when he had been out all night and to make him remember her and their children when he began succumbing to the bloodlust. Their daughter, the Young Girl, still resides in Central Yharnam, unless the Hunter sends her to Iosefka’s Clinic, where she becomes a Celestial Minion, or Oedon Chapel, where she will get killed by the Maneater Boar. The Tiny Music Box will be given to the Hunter when speaking with the Young Girl and can be used against Father Gascoigne to stun him during battle.\n\nDuring his final hunt, Gascoigne finally succumbed to the bloodlust, becoming little more than the beasts he had hunted. Viola left their home in order to search for her husband but forgot her music box; no longer remembering who she was, it appears that Gascoigne killed his own wife. He is found hacking away at corpses by the Hunter, who puts Gascoigne down.",

            "lore": "Vicar Amelia is a high-ranking member of the Healing Church, the successor of Laurence, and to whom his Gold Pendant has been passed down.\n In stark contrast with the Beast Patients, people that slowly turn into monsters under layers of bandages, this woman shows perfectly what happens when a human mutates suddenly into a full-fledged Beast: at first Amelia is seen as a normal female priest with tattered white robes, kneeling and reciting a prayer, but after a few instants she changes abruptly. Her skin ruptures under the force of her new body, splattering blood all around: now another kind of Cleric Beast, her ash blonde hair has become a long wild mane while her face, covered by scraps of her clothes like the rest of her body, has turned into a lupine head with thin antlers and a slasher smile of sharp teeth.\nEven if she appears less bulky and almost skeletal compared to both male Cleric Beasts, she is far from weak and frail: her hands' talons, which she can extend like a cat, are sharp and so hard that they emit sparks while grinding on stone. Her scrawny arms are powerful as well, being able to create a strong shockwave by smashing them to the floor.\nEven the same Gold Pendant that she still clutches proves to be more than a simple locket: Amelia is able to use it to channel energy in order to start healing her wounds in a pillar of golden light, thus making it some sort of Hunter Tool.\nAs a 'True' Beast she will take extra damage from Serration.\n",
